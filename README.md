Welcome to Slice of Italy
==========================

WHAT
----
This app pulls in images from the Flickr API and displays them in a fully responsive image grid styled using CSS only. 

WHY
---
The reason I worked on this project was to become comfortable using AJAX and third party APIs, as well build on my understanding of CSS positioning (hence the lack of a CSS framework such as Bootstrap).


FUTURE CHANGES
--------------
Changes currently being worked on:

* Adding a form to ask for user input as a search string (search by image tags)

* Adding additional jQuery and CSS for image effects and styling purposes
